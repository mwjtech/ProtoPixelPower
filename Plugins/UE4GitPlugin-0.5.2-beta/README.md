Known issues:
- reverting an asset does not seem to update content in Editor! Issue in Editor?
- renaming an asset does not seem to be handled correctly by the Editor...
- renamed file may not be tracked correctly (not yet tested, see above)
- file history does not report file size
- Windows only (64bits)

### Getting started

#### Install Git

Under Windows 64bits, you could either:
- install a standalone Git, usually in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\git.exe".
- or copy a [portable Git](https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?can=1&q=PortableGit)
inside "<UnrealEngine>/Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/git/Win32".

#### Initialize your Game Project directory with Git

Use your favorite Git program to initialize and manage your whole game project directory.
For instance:

```
C:/Users/<username>/Documents/Unreal Projects/<YourGameProject>
```

#### Install this Git Plugin

There are a few ways to use a Plugin with UE4.

See also the [Plugins official Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Plugins/index.html)

##### Within a standard installed Unreal Engine binary release:

You can simply [download a ZIP of source code from the latest release](https://github.com/SRombauts/UE4GitPlugin/releases),
and unzip it under the "Plugins" directory of the Engine, beside PerforceSourceControl and SubversionSourceControl:

```
<UnrealEngineInstallation>/4.1/Engine/Plugins/Developer
```

Or you can clone the plugin repository, and as the name of the destination directory is unimportant, its just:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SRombauts/UE4GitPlugin.git
```

##### Within an Unreal Engine source release from GitHub:

Donwload and unzip or clone the plugin repository under the "Plugins" directory of the Engine, beside PerforceSourceControl and SubversionSourceControl:

```
<UnrealEngineClone>/Engine/Plugins/Developer
```

Take care of using the name **GitSourceControl** as destination directory (same name as the "GitSourceControl.uplugin" file):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SRombauts/UE4GitPlugin.git GitSourceControl
```

##### Within your Game Project only

Alternatively, you could choose to install the plugin into a subfolder or your Game Project "Plugins" directory:

```
<YourGameProject>/Plugins
```

In this case, you will obviously only be able to use the plugin within this project.

#### Enable Git Plugin within the Editor

Launch the UE4 Editor, then open:

```
Windows->Plugins, enable Editor->Source Control->Git
```

click Enable and restart the Editor.

#### Activate Git Source Control for your Game Project

Load your Game Project, then open:

```
File->Connect To Source Control... -> Git: Accept Settings
```
